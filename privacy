Effective Date: [Insert Date]

AutoCord ("the Bot") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what data the Bot collects, how it is used, and your rights regarding that data.

1. 📥 What Data We Collect
AutoCord only collects minimal data necessary to operate its features. This may include:

User ID (for identifying who interacted with the bot)

Server ID (to identify which server the bot is operating in)

Channel ID (for message delivery)

Message content (only messages sent to or through the bot)

2. 🛠️ How We Use Your Data
The data collected is used only for core functionality, including:

Responding to direct messages

Executing server-based commands (e.g. !say)

Tracking triggers for automated responses (if configured)

3. 🗑️ Data Retention
We do not store message content long-term.

Any data stored temporarily (for command processing or logs) is cleared regularly.

No data is used for analytics, marketing, or sold to third parties.

4. 🤝 Data Sharing
We do not share your data with any third parties.

Your data stays between you, your server, and AutoCord. If external storage is ever used (e.g. for uptime logs), it will follow standard security practices.

5. 🧑‍⚖️ Your Rights
As a user, you have the right to:

Request deletion of your data from our systems

Ask what data we may have (if any)

6. 🛡️ Security
We follow best practices to protect user data, including:

Token security (bot tokens are kept secret)

Limited admin access

Safe handling of message content

However, no system is 100% secure, and use is at your own risk.

7. 🚫 Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be posted with an updated "Effective Date." Continued use of AutoCord implies acceptance of any changes.
